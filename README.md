# Percolation Visualizer

## Description
A visualizer for the percolation problem. Uses *Weighted Union Find with Path Compression* for solving the problem and *StdDraw* from *alg4.jar* to draw.  
  
Includes real-time flow which looks very pretty but is performance heavy, do NOT use for larger samples. Instead, calculate filled sites at the end of the program when percolation happens.
