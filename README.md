# Percolation Visualizer

## Description
A visualizer for the percolation problem. Uses *Weighted Union Find with Path Compression* for solving the problem and *StdDraw* from *alg4.jar* to draw.  
  
Includes real-time flow which looks very pretty but is performance heavy, do NOT use for larger samples. Instead, calculate filled sites at the end of the program when percolation happens.

## Installation
Yank the entire directory and run  <code>PercolationVisualizer.java</code>  
**External libraries used**: This project uses *alg4.jar* which is included in  <code>/lib</code>. Add it to the referenced libraries.  

## Usage
Enter two *ints* seperated by a  whitespace. The first corresponds to size of the grid, the second to number of trials.  
As an example, <code>*Sample size and trials*: **20 10**</code> will make a 20 by 20 grid and run 10 trials on it.

After each trial, the percent of sites open will show when percolation occurs for a brief moment (default: *1.5s*, can be changed). After the end of all trials, the mean percent of sites, standard deviation, and other data are shown.

**Important:** You can change <code>*boolean* realTimeFlow</code> to toggle the real time flow after every site is opened. For higher sample sizes, it is very performance heavy.
